Modeling and Evaluation
Three regression models were developed to predict fuel consumption:
1.	Random Forest Regressor
o	RÂ² Score: 0.99998 (highest accuracy).
o	Cross-Validation: Consistent with minimal variance.
2.	Gradient Boosting Regressor
o	RÂ² Score: 0.99993.
o	Slightly less consistent than Random Forest.
3.	Support Vector Regressor
o	RÂ² Score: 0.84925.
o	Moderate accuracy with greater variability.
